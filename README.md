<!-- ABOUT -->
## About
* "What makes a good developer?" That's what I asked myself a long time ago. I learned software engineering in a group of people and got to see every single person in the group give up. They said, "I'm simply, not a programmer. It's not for me". However, I've never seen someone fail at learning to program, if they never gave up. Disgraceful: for the soul to give up when the body is still going strong.
